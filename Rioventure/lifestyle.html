                        <div class="desc"><h2>Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca)</h2><p>Tijuca Forest is an extraordinary natural attraction in Rio. As the largest urban forest in the world, it is home to astonishing species of fauna and flora, a few that exist nowhere else in the world and depend solely on Tijuca’s environment for survival. There are also a handful of manmade attractions here that are worth visiting, such as Vista Chinesa, a Chinese-style gazebo with panoramic views over Lagoa and Ipanema.</p></div>

                    <h2>People</h2>
                    <p>They say a city is nothing without its people, natives of Rio are known as cariocas - and there are a lot of them!  Rio is Brazil's second city in terms of size, after São Paulo. The population officially stands at 7 million, although the real figure for the metroplitan area could be double that.  A sizeable proportion of these people – many of them arrivals from elsewhere in Brazil – live in favelas, the sprawling shanty towns which have brought Rio so much notoriety in recent years.</p>
                    <div class="container2">
                        <img class='PIC' src="../IMG/people.jpg" alt="people in rio">
                        <img class='PIC1' src="../IMG/people2.jpg " alt="people in rio">    
                </div>
                <p>Overall, cariocas (local residents) are friendly, charming, generous and very easy to get along with. Brazilians tend to socialise in bars and restaurants – it is not that common to be invited to their homes.  Most Brazilians will assume that English speakers are American, unless advised otherwise.</p>  
                 <h2>Language</h2> 
                <p>Brazil is truly a foreign language posting – it is essential to learn at least some basic Portuguese, just to survive daily life.  Although more Brazilians speak a little English now, outside multinational companies and the tourist zone, it is difficult to find anyone who can communicate effectively in anything other than Portuguese. So RIOventure advices you to brush up on your Portuguese speaking skills or at least always have a digital translator on you.</p>
               <h2>Eating out in Rio de Janeiro</h2>
               <div class="container3">
                   <p>From fast-food joints to five-star establishments, Rio’s vibrant restaurant scene has a range of different types of food on offer. With wide stretches of beachside restaurants, al fresco dining is popular in the city. This is particularly evident in Copacabana, Ipanema and Barra, which are home to one of the best restaurants and snack-bars in Rio.<br>
                    <b>TIP</b>: A 10% gratuity (gorjeta) is automatically included on the bill. There is therefore no need to tip any further than the amount.

                 <img src="../IMG/sports2.jpg" alt="people cycling in rio">
                 <p>With one of the most stunning beaches and landscapes in the world right on their doorstep, Cariocas always find time to enjoy some fun in the sun. Locals enjoy an active lifestyle and spend much of their time outdoors enjoying leisure activities, including cycling, jogging and beach volleyball. Brazilians love football (soccer) and the city is home to the Maracanã Stadium, one of the world’s largest football stadiums. Watching a game can be a thrilling experience for expats. </p>
             </div>
             <h2>Shopping in Rio de Janeiro</h2>
             <p>The malls in Rio offer many world-famous brands, as well as cinemas and food courts making them perfect for family outings. Those who want to avoid malls will find that the city also offers a few markets that are worth visiting . Rua Lavradio in Lapa and Feira do Rio Antigo are great options for antiques, art , and music lovers. While  de Sao Cristovao offers stalls selling food, drinks and households products.</p>

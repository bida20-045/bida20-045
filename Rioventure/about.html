            Rio de Janeiro also known by its full name , Cidade de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro or simply Rio is the second most popular city is Brazil with a population of 6.748 million (2020). It is located on the Atlantic Ocean, in the south-eastern part of the tropical zone of South America and is widely recognised as one of the world’s most beautiful and interesting urban centres. Although Rio de Janeiro continues to be the preeminent icon of Brazil in the eyes of many in the world, in reality its location, architecture, inhabitants, and lifestyle make it highly unique when compared with other Brazilian cities, especially the country’s capital of Brasília or the much larger city of São Paulo.

               <h1>HISTORY OF RIO</h1>
               <h2>A Brief Walk Through History</h2>
               <div class="container2">
<p> Rio de Janeiro is the city it is today because of its rich historical past. On the 1st January 1502 Portuguese rulers were the first ones to rule Rio when they landed on the soil of Guanabara Bay. In 1555 the French Huguenots established a colony, but they were driven out (1560–67) by Mem de Sá, governor-general of the Portuguese colony of Brazil. To protect from further invasions, the city was moved to a safer position on a hill, which was later named ‘Castle Hill’. At the same time the city of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro was founded by Mem de Sá's cousin. The settlement was captured and held for ransom by the French in 1711. Rio gained importance in the 18th cent., when it was designated the shipping point for all gold from the interior. It replaced Bahia (now Salvador) as the capital of Brazil in 1763 and subsequently became capital of the exiled royal court of Portugal (1808–21), the Brazilian empire (1822), and the federal republic (1889). It was superseded as capital by Brasília in 1960. The city hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics</p>

<h2>A Liberated Rio</h2>
<p>As Rio achieved independence from the Portuguese rulers, the city expanded politically, culturally, economically and architecturally. Public transportation in the form of horse-drawn trolleys allowed transport to places like Botafogo, Sao Cristovao, Tijuca which were somewhat far from the city. Rio became the political, economic and cultural centre of Brazil. Many talented artisans, leaders, writers and notable people played a significant role in the cultural development of the city. Along with being the busiest port in Brazil, the rail & road infrastructure lead to the development of the trade industry
</p>
<h2>Rio As Brazil's Capital</h2>
<p>When Brazil achieved independence in 1889, Rio was named the capital. With years passing by, Rio has changed, in terms of infrastructure and financially. After World War II, Rio shifted from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy. Bridges were built between important cities, skyscrapers were constructed, and free-ways were developed. The population of the city increased in exponentially , and this turned out to be a malediction. Even if labour needed the industries to develop, labourers were too many, and the number of poor and unskilled people increased. This situation exists even today and puts intense pressure on Rio’s resources. Hence why Rio is one of the most populated cities in the world.</p>
<h2>Present Rio</h2>
<p>In the 1960s the capital of Brazil was moved from Rio to Brasilia and later to Sao Paolo, to reduce the economic and financial pressure on Rio. Political power was moved to the interior of the country. Today along with its various ethnic groups, Rio is making its presence felt in the industrial, service and tourism sector. Major multinational companies have their headquarters in Rio, and the city does have its influence on the Brazilian economy, as a whole.</p>

         <h1>FACTS</h1>
         <p>Rio is known all over the world as the wonderful city, ‘A Cidade Maravilhosa’. But if you think the beaches and samba are all Rio has to offer, think twice. There are many interesting facts about Rio de Janeiro to discover still.<br><i>Here are some fun facts:</i></p>
    <h2>Legal street art </h2>    
    <img src="../IMG/bicicleta-photo-by-London-Graffiti-1000x770.jpg" alt="Rio graffiti">
    <img src="../IMG/IMG_9297-1280x920.jpeg" alt="Rio graffiti">
    <p>Yes you read that right art on the streets is legal! Stroll through the streets of Rio and it won’t take long to see how much street art decorates the city’s buildings.

<h2>Home to the world’s largest urban forest</h2>
<p>The Tijuca Forest is the largest man-made urban forest in the world, Rio’s wonderful mix of nature and urban life. Before reforestation, the place was home to coffee farms. Today, the Tijuca National Park is home to 328 species of animals, including amphibians, birds, and mammals. Some of them are in danger of extinction. It is also home to several tourist attractions such as the Christ the Redeemer statue, the Vista Chinesa and Parque Lage.</p>
<h2>Christ the Redeemer is one of the new Seven Wonders of the World</h2>
<p>The most symbolic and iconic of Rio’s attractions is the Christ the Redeemer, a huge statue of Jesus Christ that overlooks the city from its perch on top of the Corcovado mountain. In 2007, it was elected as one of the World’s New Seven Wonders, joining the exclusive list that includes the Great Wall of China and Machu Picchu in Peru.</p>
<h2>Samba schools are more than just Carnival parades</h2>
<p>Brazil’s samba schools are mostly famed for their vibrant appearances during Rio’s Carnival parades. However, they have a much deeper involvement in their local community. Often based near favelas (low-income Brazilian settlements), the samba schools spend all year preparing for the following year’s parades and provide free education, such as English classes and sports activities, to favela residents who aren’t able to afford those resources. The schools hold weekend events with samba dancing and feijoada, a type of Brazilian bean stew. As a result, people are passionately loyal to samba schools the same way they are to football teams.</p>
<h2>Rio has the biggest Carnival party in the world</h2>
<p>Rio de Janeiro has the largest Carnival party in the world. In 2004, over 400,000 foreign tourists flocked to the city for the celebrations to join the 5 million locals who already participate in the famous parades and street parties.</p>
